# Overview
From time immemorial, skin care has been a key factor for beauty. How well one takes care of  their skin can enhance or worsen their beauty.  Since skin care is vital for beauty, especially for women, companies have seized the opportunity to create skin care products.

However, sometimes the products don’t work well with certain skin types, or they don’t work as promised. These lead to customers complaining, or in other cases praising the products, if they help. These feedback is vital for the companies, since they help the companies know when the product is performing well or poorly.
Having a system/tool to look at customer feedback and analyze them is a key factor for the success of the company, since it helps to generate insights  and in turn improve products, and eventually  sales.
